        <p>Rust is a new systems programming language.</p>
        <p>Some of Rust's features and characteristics are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            compiled language, offering high-performance, low memory usage and
            requires a minimal runtime
          </li>
          <li>
            automatic memory management without garbage collection, based on its
            novel lifetime model
          </li>
          <li>
            statically typed, with powerful type inferrence so you almost never
            have to explicitly specify a variable's type
          </li>
          <li>
            provides algebraic data types
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For more information, I recommend going through
          <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank"
            >The Rust Programming Language book</a
          >, available for free on the Rust documentation site.

        <header>Hello world!</header>
        <p>
          Creating a new executable with Cargo will produce a template with the
          classic <i>hello world</i> program.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Let's break this (very simple) example up into parts, for clarity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>fn</code> is a <em>keyword</em> used to define a new
              function. Since functions are used a lot in procedural programs,
              it makes sense to keep the syntax for declaring them as short as
              possible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>main</code> is the name of the function. The main function
              is special, it will be called by the operating system when the
              user runs the program.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>()</code> indicate the list of parameters received by the
              function. For <code>main</code>, this must always be empty.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <code>{ ... }</code> syntax should be familiar to anyone with
              previous experience in C or a C-like programming language. It
              indicates the start of a new block of code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>println!</code> is a <em>macro</em> (you can tell that by
              the fact it's called by adding a <code>!</code> to its name).
              Before you complain, it's important to note that Rust macros are
              nowhere like C macros, but rather like the Lisp ones. They are
              natively understood by the compiler, have proper identifier
              hygiene, and none of the pitfalls or limitations the C ones have.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason <code>println</code> is a macro, not a function, is to
              allow the compiler to statically check that the format specifiers
              are correct and have corresponding arguments. You will not
              encounter bugs related to incorrect <code>printf</code>/<code
                >scanf</code
              >
              format strings in Rust.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>"Hello world!"</code> is a string. If you're coming from a
            language like Python or JavaScript, be careful: double quotes
            (<code>"</code>) are for <em>strings</em> and single quotes
            (<code>'</code>) are for <em>characters</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables_and_expressions" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables and expressions</header>
        <p>
          Declaring new variable bindings is simple, just use the
          <code>let</code> keyword:
        </p>
        <pre><code>let x = "Hello!";</code></pre>
        <p>
          Rust is an <em>expression-oriented</em> language, in the sense that
          you can even have blocks of code evaluate to a value, and use that
          recursively to form new expressions.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let x = {
  let z = 2 + 2;
  z
} - 5 * {
  let y = 14;
  y - 1
};
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notice how I didn't add semicolons (<code>;</code>) to the last
          expressions in each inner block. That's because Rust will give the
          value of that final expression to the whole block.
        </p>

      <section id="Declaring_functions" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring functions</header>
        <p>
          You've already seen above how to define the
          <code>main</code> function. If you want to define other functions as
          you can follow the same pattern, and perhaps take in some arguments or
          return a value:
        </p>
        <pre><code>fn my_function(a: u8, b: String) -> u64 {
  // ...
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          In case it's not obvious, <code>u8</code> and <code>u64</code> are
          primitive types defining fixed-width <b>u</b>nsigned integers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>String</code> is a heap-allocated array of UTF-8 characters.
          Rust strings are not null-terminated; instead, they are represented as
          a pointer along with the length of the allocated array.
        </p>
        <p>Calling functions is also a breeze:</p>
        <pre><code>fn main() {
  let result = my_function(123, String::from("Hello"));
  // ...
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          Note the use of <code>String::from</code> which creates a new owned
          string from an array slice of characters, such as a string literal.
          Allocations are easily visible in Rust.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Structs_and_traits" class="main-section">
        <header>Structs and traits</header>
        <p>
          You can create your own composite data types using the
          <code>struct</code> keyword:
        </p>
        <pre><code>struct MyStruct {
  some_field: String,
  some_other_field: u32,
  // ...
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          Structures can be instantiated by specifying a value for each of their
          fields.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let my_struct = MyStruct {
  some_field: String::from("hi!"),
  some_other_field: 123456,
  // ...
};</code></pre>
        <p>
          Traits can be used to abstract away common behavior of data types:
        </p>
        <pre><code>trait Frobnicable {
  fn frobnicate();
}

impl Frobnicate for MyStruct {
  fn frobnicate() { /* ... */ }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          One great advantage of traits is that you can implement your traits on
          types defined externally, such as built-ins or from external
          libraries.
